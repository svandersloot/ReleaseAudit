Root Cause: Contact is deleted in CM



Steps to Reproduce:

# Create a new vendor in CC which will go for 1099 approval in CM
# User cannot issue a payment to the new vendor until it’s approved in CM by 1099 team
# 1099 team rejected the contact and deleted it in the CM
# Once contact is deleted in CM, adjuster will see the contact is unlinked in CC
# Adjuster will issue a payment in CC on a deleted CM vendor contact 
# Payment is successful in CC and CM will throw error back to CC in 1099Reporting queue that vendor not found.



Proposed Fix:

# Modify the ""The check cannot be created for a contact that is not linked to the Address Book"" validation to identify contacts that are rejected as part of the “Pending Changes → Create” ContactManager intake process, so that no check can be issued to a vendor that is not in ContactManager.

There is some validation that occurs against the policy graph when in Prod mode to ensure the validity of the policy image. This validation uses the API schemas to check the structure of the policy. Now, back when we were working on Project Mercury, scheduled items were not part of the APD product generation, meaning the API schemas did not include as part of the base offering any schema definition for scheduled items. In order to support that, we built our own implementation of the scheduled item entity. That schema was built around the CA7 product definition and included a property called options. That property is not available on the CAP product, which should have thrown an error during earlier updates, but it appears that Scheduled Items were not included in previous versions. 

In Mammoth, there appears to have been a fix done by GW which then included validation of scheduled items, and because our extensions called out a property called options that wasn’t present on CAP, existing CAP policies began to fail validation. However, by this point, we’re no longer using the API that required the introduction of that extension schema and, by now, OOTB now includes a mapping for scheduled item. To resolve this issue, the old extension was removed, leaving only validation against the OOTB schema, which is working fine.

Impact of this rollback is that CA7 quoting integrations with scheduled prop will no longer work. This has been communicated, but it is not a concern at this point given the status of the CA7 product and lack of any external integrations utilizing the scheduled item.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Done,22/May/25 1:11 PM

The standard documentation will provide additional details about what’s expected.
* If after reviewing those sources, if more guidance is needed, reach out to Sabra Domeika.
* If there are any questions about the flagged instance (ie, if you think it was a false positive), contact Sabra with the instance in question to see if we need to go back to GW and contest the flagged instance.
* Address all instances raised.
* Run the [SurePath Assurance Plugin|https://csaaig.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MO/pages/3202416916/Installing+Reviewing+Static+Analysis+Plugin] after the code has been updated to ensure that no instance of the rule is still being flagged.
* Identify any areas of regression that might be need to be executed post implementation and have QA run that regression prior to closing the story. While this is a technical story, if something like a configuration is changed, testing should be done to ensure that an integration leveraging that configuration (as an example) is not harmed by the update.

Standard to reference for this finding is: [IS-TLS-1299|https://docs.guidewire.com/cloud/standards/latest/Tools/Standard-IS-TLS-1299-ReadingAndWritingFiles.html]

This story covers the following instances reported by GW:

Violation content: FileUtils.forceMkdir(destinationDirectory)]|

*TESTING SCOPE:*

* Regression test General Ledger flow and ensure that the file is able to be produced and processed. 
** Include coordination with Finance Team to run the file and confirm no issues.
* Validation of specific products/data/etc is not necessary. Only the generation of the file is necessary.
* Regression test of validation should cover both creation of the file in an AWS region and also creation of the file locally. The latter may need dev support to execute and validate.

*DEVELOPMENT NOTE:*

* Please use the format for checking local configuration called out in the standard. Please do not use some other util. This will cause an issue with the scans to still consider the issue as failed. The scans aren’t that intelligent.

*Acceptance Criteria*

* Ability to have an adjustment factor per coverage - BI, Medpay, PIP, PD, UM, and APD
** System table updates effective 10/1/25.
** CW Rate book effective 10/1/25.
* Ability to calculate adjusted premium per coverage using the coverage specific adjustment factor.
** See example attached.
* Requires rate routine calculation changes to split Liability BI and Liability PD.
** Liability BI Term Amount = Liability BI Factor for given Period/Rate Bucket * Adjustment Factor * Harsh Brake Mileage
** Liability PD Term Amount = Liability PD Factor for given Period/Rate Bucket * Adjustment Factor * Harsh Brake Mileage
** Liability [BI + PD] Term Amount = Liability BI Term Amount + Liability PD Term Amount
** No changes needed for UM/UIM.

* Harshbrake rates are based on Policy effective date 
* Harshbrake adjustment factors will be effective on any transactions effective from adjustment factor effective date
* Adjustment factors are going to be introduced for each coverage
* Policy will be renewed effective 10/1/2025 and the new adjustment factor will be in effect from 4/1/2026
* Impact:
   1. Adj factor will have to accounted in calculation for every coverage in every HB bucket
    2. Math for BI + PD liability will change since there is adj separately for BI and separately for PD as part of this change. This affects all states
    3. Math for UM + UIM where both are present need to be considered
     4. The change is expected on all states under Harshbrake
     5. New rate books are going to be introduced as part of this change
     6. Country wide rate book is created for fallback for other states

*Decisions on Release:*

Goal is to move all states together to Prod in June release. Code change will begin in April but will be merged into QA after May code freeze. Testing will be done in ‘QA only’ stories in groups of few states.

*Scope of test* 

- All states under HarshBrake for all periods will have to be tested
23 states x 3 periods  = 69 policies. 

The new adjustment factor should reflect in audits and all transactions

Since there is change in structure, existing policies should be tested for Regression impact

Testing on existing Lyft rideshare is recommended by PO

* Suggestion from QA side: 
** As part of regression, pick a few existing Harshbrake policies and verify the audit can be completed on it without issues and has old rates since there is impact on the structure
** Check if policy change is mandated on the existing policies when new rate book is getting introduced. 
** Recommended :
1 under Admitted - 3 periods
1 under Surplus - 3 periods

# We should be able to enter an APD limit during policy change for existing policies.
# The availability of the APD Limit under State is not driven by the selection of Collision/Other than Collision. But, if Collision/Other than Collision are not selected, the APD limit will not be passed to CC.
## In production, Collision/Other than Collision will always be selected if there is going to be an APD limit.
# Its fine to keep the label under Collision/Other than Collision.
# For reinstatement, changes can’t be made to the policy during the transaction. So, APD limit cannot be changed.

*** Coverage Names for MedPay/PIP - Medical Payments and Personal Injury Protection.
** A single policy can have up to 51 jurisdictions and up to 3 unique coverages (above) per location.
** Solution: Currently there is a unique key generated per policy per coverage to identify a record from DynamoDB while creating a GL line item (e.g. {{VABA140001299330_04/30/2024 00:01:00_1}}). This logic to generate the Unique key needs to be changed to ensure it can still uniquely identify same coverage for a policy at multiple states.
* Ability to deliver the Monthly Estimated Earned Premium (EEP) file to General Ledger with multi- state policies.
** Ensure each jurisdiction is sequenced together for a single policy.
* Ensure no impacts to current ingestion process or schedules [Regression]
