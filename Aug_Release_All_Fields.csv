[Tech Enabler] Update Logging Framework Version - CM/CC,MOBPXD-1063,1291274,Story,Analysis,MOBPXD,Mobi Super Product,software,Crystal Chapman,712020:2305961c-4962-4646-9b4b-a0320002081b,,Not Set,,Swathi Garapati,6086df09bb0b0500704d4f0e,Nathaniel Fickel,5fecf6448332a1010eac1aec,Nathaniel Fickel,5fecf6448332a1010eac1aec,18/Dec/24 5:01 PM,16/Jul/25 10:38 AM,,,Mobilitas 2025.08.08,,,,,,,0,"*Problem Statement*

Currently, we’re using an older version of the SurePath Structured Logger framework as it was originally implemented a number of releases ago. This has presented some challenges recently, such as a disconnect with DataDog when the logs are written, leading to additional details missing from the logs when searched. This also leads to problems around Cloud Assurance where the SurePath is being flagged as out of compliance 

*Business/Technical Benefit*

Resolving the current issue will allow us to provide more details in the DataDog logs which will help Operations triage potential issues more quickly, which will then reduce impact in Production as issues are more quickly brought to resolution. We will also be able to reduce the amount of Cloud Assurance findings that we are responsible for as we will be utilizing the most recent and supported SurePath, making any sort of issues/findings the responsibility of GW rather than us.

*Requirements:*

* Latest version of logging SurePath for Mammoth should be consumed from the marketplace.
* Datadog should be validated to ensure that all parameters defined are appearing in the logs after the consumption of the new SurePath version.
* Validation needs to be done for at least one instance where current debugWithMethodRef is utilized post consumption.
* Validation does not need to be done for every logged statement, but validation for each logging level should be done on the application server – ie, info, debug – to ensure that data is being logged appropriately post consumption.
* Validation against TC should be done to ensure that all Cloud Assurance findings for Structured Logger have been resolved with this consumption. See below for list of current findings against ClaimCenter. If, after consuming the latest SurePath, the Cloud Assurance scans are still showing one or more failures, please contact Sabra to have her open an exception with Guidewire.

*Dependencies/Impacts*

* N/A

*Non Functional Requirements*

* N/A

*Design Options/Solutions*

* Consume updated SurePath found here: [https://marketplace.guidewire.com/s/product/surepath-components-for-insurancesuite/01t3n00000GfLRvAAN|https://marketplace.guidewire.com/s/product/surepath-components-for-insurancesuite/01t3n00000GfLRvAAN]
* Please note that the SurePath contains more than just logger updates. The only updates in scope here are for the logging updates. Please do not include additional updates as a part of this – any other updates will be handled via other epics, as needed. 
* Once the updated logging framework is consumed, the method debugWithMethodRef has been removed as part of the SurePath update. This will impact a large number of methods. Rather than update each instance manually (which would also necessitate a large amount of retest), add a new debugWithMethodRef method into the StructuredLogger class. In that newly added method, call the debug method, passing over the updated order of parameters.

*Test Strategy/Test Coverage*

* *Test Approach*
** *Test First Development*
*** This is not a TFD candidate.
** *Functional Testing*
*** PC
**** Create transactions in environment where debug is enabled
***** Work with dev to determine environment
*** Datadog
**** Make sure all parameters are appearing
***** Work with dev to understand what you need to check for.
* *Test Environment*
** TT/QA - Sprint Level Activities (to be confirm by team) || TT2/SIT - SIT/Regression Testing || UAT - N/A || DB Drop Needed - No
* *Impacted Features:*
** Regression testing Scope for Impacts
*** None
* *Entry Criteria:*
** Instructions and Acceptance Criteria established and outlined.
* *Exit Criteria*:
** DataDog displays all pertinent logging details, particularly any parameters defined, for each logging level.

*Problem:*
Currently, our AWS stack uses account-specific SSM and secrets parameters. This approach is causing issues with parameter management and scalability across different environments. 

*Solution:*

To address this, we need to update the following SSM/Secrets to be environment-specific instead of account-specific. Additionally, we need to update the code segments that reference these parameters and tear down the now unused account-specific SSM/Secrets. Finally, we must test all impacted systems to ensure they function correctly with the new environment-specific parameters.

Callout: The dates 10/15/2024 and 9/15/2024 has Update and Delete with vehicles which are not present in the policy. There are no other vehicles present for that date.

Issue 4: Bound transactions which have skipped vehicles are reported in both success and Could not be bound emails.

0002697429 and 0002538550 which were dummy policy change transactions are reported in both success email and ‘Could not be bound email’

To note: The vehicles which were not present in policy are correctly reported in the skipped email

Need clarification if this can be empty transactions bound when all vehicles for that date errored out.

Based on above decision, need clarification if it is ok to report these kinds of transactions in both success and Could not bound emails.

One of the policy transactions in the input file did not happen due to invalid data in the input file . 
However the message below gives impression that all expected policy changes were completed.

Callout 2:  

When there is error message due to the effective date being outside of the policy term, below message is received.

!image-20250708-000327.png|width=1118,height=383,alt=""image-20250708-000327.png""!

Callout - there is no reference to Policy number or file name in the email, to trace the issue.

Proposed fix:

Fix verbiage to below

SKip the vehicle and report it in Skipped email. No need to report this in the “Could not be bound email”

Additional callout : 

The missed VIN should be reported in the skipped email .

+*Acceptance Criteria:*+

* Ability to setup a batch process for automated policy changes.
** Batch should run daily and process all files in the S3 folder.
** {color:#36b37e}Batch should run every day at 12 pm and 7 pm. [Follow time zone as other batch runs]{color}
* Ability to setup an automated super user profile with necessary permissions to perform these policy changes.
** Use existing user - policychange_daemon
* Ability to systematically create individual policy changes for each effective date, as identified in the file.
** For example, if there are 5 different effective dates in the file, the system will automate 5 different policy changes.
** Policy changes will be processed in sequential order and will follow a synchronous process flow.
*** If a policy change fails, the other pending files/policy changes will not be processed until the failed transaction is handled manually.
**** The remaining, unprocessed files will be processed during the next batch.
*** The effective date entered into the column will be used as the policy change [transaction] effective date and sent to ALIRts [existing behavior].
**** This effective date will be sent to ALIRtS as the,
***** Vehicle effective date for vehicle adds = Coverage Effective Date in ALIRtS
***** Vehicle expiration date for vehicle deletes = Vehicle Cancellation Effective Date in ALIRtS
***** Effective date for vehicle updates - for updates, do we send a date?
** {color:#36b37e}In the case of 2- year term policies, the same vehicles could be added to more than one policy - need to ensure we are not failing an import file as duplicate.{color}
* Ability to skip vehicle entries that fail due to import failures, such as duplicate VIN, and continue to process the policy change.
** If a vehicle results in a duplicate VIN, this vehicle will not be added again.
** Skip scenarios: [may not be holistic]
*** Duplicate VIN, Missing Year/Make/Model/VIN, Effective Date outside of policy term
* Email Notifications:
** Ability to create an email notification confirming policy changes were successful.

The data validation for valid values in the columns Registration state, Vehicle Type, Color Code, Registration Plate type is handled only by the Input validation in the Input template.

!image-20250707-230348.png|width=1920,height=1032,alt=""image-20250707-230348.png""!



Once saved as csv close and re-opened or if an existing processed csv is copied and opened, the input validation might not be present. This is as per capabilities of standard csv.

Since it is an overhead to catch for valid dropdown value validation in the Batch process, It is recommended and decided to always work from the template which has the input validation. Not using the correct template and having invalid data can cause vehicle not getting imported or the missed vehicles not getting reported.

*Instructions:*

* Review the instances below.
* Check the Remediation column for more details about what’s expected.
* If more details are needed, check the Guidewire Cloud Standard ID column and get the standard ID for the triggered rule. Go to the [GW Standards documentation|https://docs.guidewire.com/cloud/standards/latest/Overview/overview.html] and search for the standard. The standard documentation will provide additional details about what’s expected.
* If after reviewing those sources, if more guidance is needed, reach out to Sabra Domeika.
* If there are any questions about the flagged instance (ie, if you think it was a false positive), contact Sabra with the instance in question to see if we need to go back to GW and contest the flagged instance.
* Address all instances raised.
* Run the [SurePath Assurance Plugin|https://csaaig.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MO/pages/3202416916/Installing+Reviewing+Static+Analysis+Plugin] after the code has been updated to ensure that no instance of the rule is still being flagged.
* Identify any areas of regression that might be need to be executed post implementation and have QA run that regression prior to closing the story. While this is a technical story, if something like a configuration is changed, testing should be done to ensure that an integration leveraging that configuration (as an example) is not harmed by the update.
